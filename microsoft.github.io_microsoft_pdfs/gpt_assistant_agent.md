If None, a new assistant will be created. model: Model to use for the assistant (gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106). check_every_ms: check thread run status interval tools: Give Assistants access to OpenAI-hosted tools like Code Interpreter and Knowledge Retrieval, or build your own tools using Function calling. ref https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools file_ids: files used by retrieval in run overwrite_instructions *bool* - whether to overwrite the instructions of an existing assistant. This parameter is in effect only when assistant_id is specified in llm_config.
